# OpenSBPM Workflow Definition

## Overview
OpenSBPM Workflow Definition (OSWD) is a human-readable and intuitive domain-specific language to build workflow definitions for OpenSBPM. OSWD tries to follow native spoken languages.  This repository contains the implementation of a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining subject-oriented business processes in OpenSBPM. The DSL is written in Groovy and allows intuitive process modeling using a subject-verb structure.

## Features
- **Subjekt-Verb Syntax** for defining processes
- **Form-based Task Definitions** with field properties
- **Decision-making and Workflow Control** (`send`, `receives`, `creates`)
- **Groovy-based Implementation**
- **Integration with OpenSBPM**
